\chapter{Meeting Minutes}
As a team, we used meetings to inform each other about our individual progress rather than use the time to develop our models.
As such our meetings were often short and straight forward.

We've added an abridged version of our meeting notes. For a more complete version of the meeting notes, please refer the notes and log stored at \url{https://www.github.com/vishakhkumar.ME1770}
