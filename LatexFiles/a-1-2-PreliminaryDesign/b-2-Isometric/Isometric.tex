\section{Isometric Drawings}
After sketching out our conceptual drawings and allocating tasks between team members, we then proceded to create isometric drawings of each assembly and the top level subassemblies.
This helped us refine our ideas about what our parts would look like and how we could improve them.
As our product was fairly complicated, we also had the benefit of improving our drawing skills - more than a few parts had interesting features that were a challenge to draw.
