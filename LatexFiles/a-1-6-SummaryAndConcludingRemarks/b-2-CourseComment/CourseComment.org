Throughout this project we faced many challenges in the SolidWORKS program.  Each challenge needed a unique solution and helped us all to learn about many different features of SolidWORKS that we did not know prior to the project.  For example, we gained experience and figured out how to work with subassemblies within a larger assembly.  The probem we faced with this aspect was the fact that when subassemblies are placed into a final assembly they are unable to move within the subassembly unless they are made to be flexible.  We went through a complext process to figure out how to make a subassembly flexible and also be able to be animated.  During Visakh's creation of the cockpit, he learned a great deal on surface modeling techniques and how to best implemnt the different tools that surface modeling has to offer.  Justin learned a great deal on how to create a functioning ball join in SolidWORKS by using a axis to axis advanced angle mate.  Juan learned everything there is to know about 3d sketches with weldments.  Assim figured oout the intricate workings of suspensions.  Also, Auston figured out how to use surface modeling as wel which was taught to him by Visakh.
