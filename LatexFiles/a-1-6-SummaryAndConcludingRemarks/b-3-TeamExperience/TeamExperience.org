We developed as a team as the proect progressed.  When we began the project we did not have any team meeting outside of class and did not have the communication network that we needed to complete the project proficiently.  However, through team communication and organized team meeting we were able to get everyone on the same page and organized.  This organizational structure of the group chat and team meeting are what made this project a great team experience.  We were all passionate about our individual subassemblies, and strived to create the best project possible.
