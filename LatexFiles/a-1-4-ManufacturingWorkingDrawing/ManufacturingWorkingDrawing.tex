Insert spiel about ManufacturingWorkingDrawing.
\begin{itemize}
\item \ref{sec:WorkingDrawing} \textbf{Working Drawings}\\
A product cannot be counted as finished unless there are plans to manufacture that product. While the plans for our product is definitely beyond the ability of a student run organization (or small countries), 
we've added working drawings to highlight important features and dimensions of our work.

\item \ref{sec:AssemblyInstructionManual} \textbf{Assembly Instruction Manual}\\
While our product is unlikely to ever reach the manufacturing line, it's prudent to think about how products are manufactured and assembled in order to create functional products.
In that spirit, we've created assembly instructions for an intrepid student to follow should s/he ever attempt building a Mars Rover.
