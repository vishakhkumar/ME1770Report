* ProjectManagement
#+BEGIN_SRC tex :tangle yes :tangle ProjectManagement.tex
With a project as complex as ours, we needed to propose a schedule for each team member to turn their parts in, a system for sharing files and method of team communication.

\begin{itemize}
\item Timeline - Gantt Chart using Excel
More about the Gantt Chart is explained in the section \ref{sec:timeline}

\item Data management - Google Drive and Github
Although Github was more suited to collaborative work, we opted to use Google Drive in order to use a platform accessiblile to all team members. However, Google Drive proved to be a problem as it synced temporary files as well as permanent files, which caused issues with references inside an assembly. 
We would not reccommend using Google Drive in the future for said reason. At the end of the project, we used Github to sync Solidworks files together and to create our report.
We have two repositories for the project and the report.
\begin{itemize}
\item ME1770 files  - \url{https://github.com/vishakhkumar/ME1770}
\item ME1770 report - \url{https://github.com/vishakhkumar/ME1770Report}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
