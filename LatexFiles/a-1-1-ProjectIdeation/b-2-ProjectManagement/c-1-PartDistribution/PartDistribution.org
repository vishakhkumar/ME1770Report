\subsubsection{Allocating subsystems among team members}

An important element of team success lies in allocating tasks to team members equitably. We kept in mind two factors while allocating tasks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The set of tasks that has to be completed (which may be one task or it may be several.)
  \item The set of individuals (the team members) able to complete them.
\end{itemize}

Given each team member's skill level and complexity of the part, we assigned tasks as shown in the table \ref{tab:allocation}

Further notes:
Since the cockpit and the controls were interrelated task, it was decided to allocate both tasks to the same person.
