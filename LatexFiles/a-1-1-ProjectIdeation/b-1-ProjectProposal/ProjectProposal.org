\subsection{Description of Product / Structure: Describe the creative ideation and what is new?}
Our product is a Mars capable ATV. We began with the idea of the standard ATV, coupled with the idea of a manned Mars rover. By combining these two concepts, we were able to create a more agile vehicle capable of handling Mars’ low gravity and dusty environment. The combination of a pressurized capsule in an off-road vehicle can be challenging but the benefits would be immense in creating robust vehicles for a manned colony on Mars.

* Why our product is unique

#+BEGIN_SRC tex  :tangle yes :tangle ProjectProposal.tex
\subsection{Briefly explain what new functionalities (system and sub-system ) you are planning to add. How your product is different from existing products:}

This design differs from the traditional ATV because it has a improved suspension system for travel along Martian terrain. The ATV will be able to withstand orbital entry into the Martian landscape through its improved suspension and parachute for controlled descent. Additionally for increased driver visibility the pressurized cabin is built with GT-Superglass® which has the material strength of hardened steel and the weight of titanium. With this glass our vehicle will be able to withstand sandstorms containing heavy debris.
